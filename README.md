# 💻 #DrGVishwanathanChallenge – My LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my personal repository for the **#DrGVishwanathanChallenge** – a self-imposed challenge to solve **one LeetCode problem every day** to build consistency and strengthen my grasp on data structures and algorithms (DSA).

This challenge is inspired by the spirit of learning in public, improving one step at a time, and staying consistent through daily problem-solving.

---

## 📅 Challenge Format

- 🔢 **One problem per day**
- 🧩 Problems are from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- 💬 Each solution folder includes:
  - A well-documented `.cpp` file with the logic
  - A `README.md` explaining the approach, complexity, and sample cases
- 🛠️ Language used: **C++**

---

## 🚀 Why This Challenge?

- ✍️ To develop consistency in DSA practice.
- 🧠 To deepen understanding of algorithms and patterns.
- 💬 To communicate solutions clearly through README files.
- 📂 To build a searchable and presentable GitHub portfolio.
- 🤝 To learn in public and connect with others doing the same.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** C++
- **Platform:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- *(Optional later)* **GitHub Pages** for a public view
