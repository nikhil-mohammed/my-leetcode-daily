# Day 39 ‚Äì Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

## üß© Problem

**Problem:** [150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)  
**Difficulty:** Medium  

> Given an expression in Reverse Polish Notation, evaluate it and return the result.

---

## üí° Approach

I used a **stack-based evaluation** method ‚Äî which naturally fits RPN format.

For each token:
- If it's an operator, pop two operands, compute the result, and push it back.
- If it's a number, simply push it on the stack.

All intermediate values are integers, and division truncates toward zero.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` ‚Äî Each token is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` ‚Äî For the stack storing operands.

| Input                                         | Output | Explanation                                |
|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|
| ["2","1","+","3","*"]                         | 9      | ((2 + 1) * 3)                              |
| ["4","13","5","/","+"]                        | 6      | (4 + (13 / 5))                             |
| ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"] | 22     | Full nested evaluation as per RPN rules   |
