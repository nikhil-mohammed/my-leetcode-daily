# Day 38 ‚Äì Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## üß© Problem

**Problem:** [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)  
**Difficulty:** Easy  

> You‚Äôre given an array where `prices[i]` is the price of a stock on the `i-th` day. Find the maximum profit you can achieve by choosing a day to buy and a later day to sell.

---

## üí° Approach

We use a **greedy algorithm** that tracks the **lowest price** so far and computes the **maximum profit** at each step.

‚úÖ Strategy:
- Initialize `minBuy` as the first price
- Loop through the array:
  - Update `maxProfit` with `price - minBuy`
  - Update `minBuy` if a lower price is found

This avoids nested loops and keeps it efficient with just a single pass.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` ‚Äî Single traversal of the prices array
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` ‚Äî Constant space used
