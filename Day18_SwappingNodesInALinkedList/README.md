# Day 18 ‚Äì Swapping Nodes in a Linked List

## üß© Problem

**Problem:** [1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/swapping-nodes-in-a-linked-list/)  
**Difficulty:** Medium

> Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer `k`, swap the values of the `k`th node from the beginning and the `k`th node from the end (1-indexed).

---

## üí° Approach

This problem is a **single pass two-pointer trick**:

- Traverse through the list:
  - When you reach the `k`th node from the beginning, store it in `left`.
  - Start a second pointer `right` from the head.
  - Continue the traversal ‚Äî when you reach the end, `right` will point to the `k`th node from the end.
- **Swap values** of the two nodes.

This avoids computing the list length or creating any auxiliary structures.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) ‚Äî One full traversal of the list.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) ‚Äî In-place with no extra memory.
