# Day 42 ‚Äì Pascal's Triangle II

## üß© Problem

**Problem:** [119. Pascal's Triangle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/)  
**Difficulty:** Easy  

> Given an integer `rowIndex`, return the `rowIndex`th (0-indexed) row of Pascal's triangle.

Each value in the row is based on the sum of two elements directly above it.

---

## üí° Approach

Instead of generating the entire triangle, we build the desired row directly using the **binomial coefficient** relationship:

\[
C(n, k) = C(n, k - 1) \times \frac{n - k + 1}{k}
\]

Steps:
- Initialize the row with the first element `1`.
- Use the formula above to compute each next element from the previous one in a loop.

This avoids unnecessary space and gives a precise and optimized construction of the target row.
