# Day 21 ‚Äì Bulb Switcher

## üß© Problem

**Problem:** [319. Bulb Switcher](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher/)  
**Difficulty:** Medium

> There are n bulbs initially off. You toggle bulbs in rounds:
> - Round 1: Turn on all bulbs.
> - Round 2: Toggle every 2nd bulb.
> - Round 3: Toggle every 3rd bulb.
> - ...
> - Round n: Toggle only the nth bulb.
>
> Return how many bulbs remain on after n rounds.

## üí° Approach

- Each bulb toggled once per divisor it has.
- Bulbs toggled an odd number of times remain on.
- Only **perfect squares** have an odd number of divisors.
- Result is count of perfect squares ‚â§ n ‚Üí `floor(sqrt(n))`.
